<p>
  A platform to students ask questions and answer to other students, an environment to help them to study, solve problems when in doubt.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
  It is an experiment that is trying to understand if students would like to ask and answer to other students, without fear to being wrong or if that question is naive, and if this works to them as a tool of study.
</p>

<p>
  The platform was already running so this was a maintenance project. A new version need to be planned with another stack, probably with an asynchronous JS, NoSQL and microservices.
