<p>
  Online Portfolio for communication professionals.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
  There are many people on communication business that don't have a portfolio online because don't have programming skills neither can afford to pay a programmer.
</p>

<p>
  MeuPortifa allows users to have a unique URL with their projects, with a proper layout and contact information.
</p>

<p>
  This project started on a Concierge MVP, with founders creating HTML files for each professional request. When idea was validated (and HTML manual productions became unmanageable) a Rails prototype was created on a weekend by Neue Labs developers. Since then, its been maintained by William.
