<a href="http://www.campusmap.com.br">CampusMap</a>

<p>
  A project made in 4 hours during Campus Party Brasil 2012. The main and only feature is to provide a high resolution map of event as a layer above Google Maps and allow Twitter usernames to pin themselves and share a unique URL.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
  Since Campus Party is a huge place and happens over one week so many attendees use to bring their computers from home and set a "base" between many rows of tables. Besides tables are arranged in big areas (Astronomy, Social Media, Games and Development) all of them look the same.
</p>

<p>
  Frequently people get lost and with same directions as nothing (eg. "I'm bellow that big banner").
</p>

<p>
  CampusMap was created for fun, with purpose to do something useful on this great technology event, that allowed a quickly spread, growth and validation.
</p>

<p>
  Worked as a full-stack developer and map designer.
